Art Museums NYC is an app that provides a directory of art museums in Manhattan. Currently, users can access general museum info, including the type of art shown, ticket prices, free admission info, hours, and address. Users can also view the museum's location on Google maps, stroll through an interior museum Google street view (if available), and view the museum's website in-app. Additional features in progress.
